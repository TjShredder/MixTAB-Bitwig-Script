# MixTAB-Bitwig-Script
A script to control Bitwig from an ancient Fostex MixTAB MIDI Controller

The MixTAB was designed to control three MIDI controlled mixers back in the last Millenium.
The "DCM SELECT" chooses between them. This is used to be able to control up to 24 Tracks in Bitwig directly.
In position 1, the MixTAB will controll the first eight Tracks in Bitwig. Position 2 & 3 accordingly Tracks 9 to 24.
Faders control Levels, the mute button will set the mute in Bitwig.
The row above will control the pan, and above those up to three sends. 
The upper button will control the input monitor (speaker symbol), to listen to the input of a track.
The Master fader will control the Master volume.
The Aux Return and smooth knobs will control the aux levels.
The Aux Send 2 knob will control the metronome level. (Very important...)
The remaining 5 knobs are not assigned yet.
The master and aux return controls are independent of the DCM SELECT setting.
